Phase 1 - Naming and writing conventions
- define each variable on a single line
- rename loan_value and use lowerCamelCase
- rename account_type and use lowerCamelCase
- rename loan() method with getLoan()
- rename calculate() method

Phase 2 - Explain yourself in code
- remove comments

Phase3 - Use enumeration for standard symbols

Phase 4 - Use Exceptions rather that Return codes
- create exception class for invalid loanValue

Phase 5 - Use interfaces
- create interfaces for the rate and for validating the value of the loan

Phase 6 - Distributing on levels
- the methods should have at most 3 imbrication levels
